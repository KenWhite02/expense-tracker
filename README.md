## Technologies Used

`React Js` was used in the creation of this project.

`Material UI` was used on the design of the cards.

The project has a `VOICE RECOGNITION` feature that was enhanced using `SPEECHLY` library. This was used so as to save the users time on typing as it's quicker to give a command by word of mouth.

The application makes use of `Local Storage` which stores the application data of the user even when the site is closed. 

For more info about `SPEECHLY` view the docs at [https://docs.speechly.com/client-libraries/react/](https://docs.speechly.com/client-libraries/react/)
